# Employee QR Code System

This system allows you to generate QR codes containing employee ID links and view comprehensive employee information on a dedicated page when scanned.

## âœ… QR Code Scanning Fix

**Issue Resolved**: QR codes were too large to scan due to excessive data.

**Solution**: QR codes now contain simple URLs with employee IDs instead of full JSON data:
- **Format**: `https://yoursite.com/admin/employee-qr-scan/{employee_id}`
- **Example**: `https://yoursite.com/admin/employee-qr-scan/240814001`

3. `qr-scanner-component.jsx` - Component for manual employee ID lookup
4. `employee-table-header-section.jsx` - Header component with QR scanner button
5. `routes/web.php` - Added routes for QR scan pages

### Data Structure
- **QR Content**: Simple URL format `/admin/employee-qr-scan/{employee_id}`
- **Data Source**: Real-time fetch from `/api/employee/{employee_id}` endpoint
- **Compact**: Short URLs that are easily scannable by any QR reader

### API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/employee/{emp_id}`
- **Controller**: `EmployeeController@show`
- **Relationships**: Automatically includes applicant, user, department, and attrition data

### Security Considerations
- QR codes only contain employee ID (no sensitive data in URL)
- Data fetched securely from backend API
- Consider adding authentication to the scan page if needed
- Employee ID exposure is minimal security risk

### Performance Benefits
- **Smaller QR codes**: Easier to scan and print
- **Real-time data**: Always shows current information
- **Cacheable URLs**: Can be bookmarked or shared
- **Database integrity**: Single source of truth

## Integration

To add the QR scanner button to your employee table:

```jsx
import QRScannerComponent from '../components/qr-scanner-component';

// In your component JSX:
<QRScannerComponent />
```

The QR generation is already integrated into the existing employee table actions menu.
